NAME
    Pangloss installation

SYNOPSIS
      % perl Build.PL
      % ./Build test
      % ./Build install

      # follow on-screen instructions

INSTALLATION
    In general, the following should work:

            % perl Build.PL
            % ./Build test
            % ./Build install

    If you want to install Pangloss somewhere other than
    /usr/local/pangloss, add a 'install_base=/path/to/install' to the first
    line, for example:

            % perl Build.PL install_base=~/pangloss

    Follow the on-screen instructions after installing Pangloss.

CONFIGURATION
    You can use the Pangloss admin tool found in the 'bin' directory to do
    most of the initial setup:

            % $PG_HOME/bin/pg_admin --help

    First off, you must setup a Pixie store for Pangloss to use (see the
    Pixie documentation for stores types available and for more details on
    Pixie). If you are setting up a DBI store, you can do it with the
    Pangloss admin tool, for example:

            pangloss> create store 'dbi:mysql:dbname=test'
            pangloss> connect 'dbi:mysql:dbname=test'

    Next, you need an admin user:

            pangloss> create admin

    Once that's done you're ready to load the pangloss webserver (you can
    use the website to create other users and such).

    Most Pangloss configuration can be done with environment variables. Read
    the Pangloss::Config documentation to see what parameters are available:

            % man Pangloss::Config
                    - or -
            % perldoc Pangloss::Config

    Pangloss requires a 'controller' configuration file, which can be
    tailored to suit your needs. The defaults live in the "$PG_HOME/conf"
    directory, and should be sensible enough for most installations.

STANDALONE TEST SERVER
    There is a standalone server available in the 'bin' directory:

            % $PG_HOME/bin/pg_test_server --help

    This is useful as a smoke test to make sure you have set all the right
    environment variables and that there are no problems. It's also handy if
    you don't have Apache or mod_perl installed but would like to try out
    Pangloss anyway.

APACHE CONFIGURATION
    Pangloss has been built to run under Apache/mod_perl. A sample
    configuration file is included:

            $PG_HOME/conf/sample-httpd.conf
