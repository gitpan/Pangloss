NAME
    Pangloss - a multilingual web-based glossary.

SYNOPSIS
      use Pangloss;

      # there's much more to it than that, of course...

DESCRIPTION
    Pangloss is a *terminology management system* who's goal is to help
    translators produce consistent translations of common terms across
    multiple languages. The system allows users to search through and manage
    terms and their translations.

    There are 4 main types of users:

    Administrators
      Admins can create, remove, or modify user accounts, languages,
      categories, concepts and terms.

    Translators
      Translators can submit & modify term translations for a given concept.

    Proofreaders
      Proofreaders can accept/reject/etc. term translations by modifying a
      term's status.

    Generic users
      Other users can search through the terms, but cannot modify any
      content.

SYSTEM OVERVIEW
    Pangloss can be broken down into these parts:

  The Application Model
    In MVC terms, Pangloss::Application and its sub-components form the
    *model* of the system. It includes exception-handling and validation
    code for collections of the following objects:

    * Pangloss::User
    * Pangloss::Language
    * Pangloss::Category
    * Pangloss::Concept
    * Pangloss::Term

    Any action by the application classes results in a view of the system
    represented by a Pangloss::Application::View.

  The Web Application
    Pangloss::WebApp acts as the *controller* of the system. It takes in a
    request and passes it through a Pipeline of modules that talk to the
    Pangloss::Application to figure out an appropriate response. Most of the
    so-called *business logic* sits at this level.

    By default Petal templates are used to present the application *view* to
    the user.

    Pangloss::WebApp is configured by environment variables passed to
    Pangloss::Config. The controller is defined by a Pipeline::Config file.

  The Shell
    Pangloss has an off-line administration tool, pg_admin.

INSTALLATION
