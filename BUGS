 Pangloss Bugs
===============

x. UserLoader segments don't use a try block!

x. Errors do not appear in /edit/add_language.html.

x. Remove-on-enter bug in editor pages.

   Pressing <enter> on editor pages removes the item!  Could use image
   submits, or just move the button so it's not first on the page.
